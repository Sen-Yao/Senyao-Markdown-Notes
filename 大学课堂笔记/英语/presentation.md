# How to appreciate a game from a designer's perspective -take Celeste for example

Oliver.Lin

Hey guys! 

As some of you may know the UniqueStudio in our school, in fact, I'm a game designer in UniqueStudio.

Today, I'd like to share with your guys how to appreciate a game as a game designer, instead of just, you know, play game.

I'd like to take a famous game Celeste for example.

## Mechanics design

### Do or die

In my personal experiments, the biggest difference between Celeste and other platform jumping game like Super Mario is that Celeste requires strong continuity in the player’s operations

Some player may be frustrated because of its high difficulty, but if player just MADE it, he or she, seeing what a smooth operation I had made! 

Highly admirable level design combined with high continuity design, player will get a great sense of accomplishment.

### Low trial cost


In my opinion, the most excellent design in Celeste is the perfect combination of subtle level design and low trial cost. In this way, player can get enough sense of accomplishment without become MAD at failure.

My roommate 胡天宇 like the game "Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy" very much. In that game, you will fall to the bottom of the mountain, which means that all the hard work player has made is in vain. As the game designer said

> A game I made
> 
> for a certain kind of person.
> 
>  To hurt them.——Bennett Foddy

That's why I can always hear 胡天宇 shout in mad when he was playing this game.

As for Celeste, the only punishment player will get is be transported back to the last save point. Player can accept this kind of punishment easily, and spare more time and effort to refine the skills.

A completely Win after countless tries, the feeling will be incredibly addictive for players.

## Level design

### Highly ornamental level


Level designer combine design elements together masterly, player have to use appropriate game skills, input all operations with a sense of rhythm.

Once the operation-chain is formed, the game will give player response with sound effects or special effects.

### Make Players Smart

> Make players feel smart and they will love your game——MVP Boardgames

One of the essence in game designing is to guide the player’s experience. As a high difficulty game, how Celeste's designer balance the gaming experience for those beginner? I'd like to introduce the learning curve of Celeste.

Here is the order of game elements. As the game progresses, player get more and more tricks to solve all kinds of enemies and puzzles. At this time, there's no doubt that player will feel "smart".

### Narration

The last point I'd like to mention is that the Narration of this game.

The main character, Madeline, is a little girl suffer from depression. As healthy people, we may find it hard to empathize with depression patients. But through this game, we can be in Madeline's shoes and just to see what it's like to struggle with depression.

As Madeline climbing the mountain, a purple-hair, gothic version of "Madeline" will keep chasing her, just like the demon in Madeline heart. 

For every depression patients, there's nothing harder than reaching consensus with the negative self. In Chapter 6, Madeline fell to the bottom of the mountain, which symbolizes that her struggle is in trouble.

But in the later chapter, Madeline reached consensus with the gothic Madeline successfully. The two girl got together, and Madeline became stronger to face difficulties on the road ahead.

In this special way, Celeste connects player who struggling to finish the game with Madeline's struggle for the fight with her fate.

That's all of my presentation. I hope you guys enjoyed it. If you are interested in game designing then click the link here, you can find more information on my personal blog.
