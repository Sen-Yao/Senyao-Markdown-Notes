# Portfolio Week 13

As Calculous and linear algebra processed, I found it harder and harder to Keep up with the professors. As a student from Fujian, my math foundation is much weaker than my classmate from other educationally powerful province like Hubei.

Fortunately, I found a fascinating YouTube channel named "3Blue1Blown", which is channel focused on showing abstract math concept in a visible way.

Grant, a graduate from Stanford University. He believed that the best way to understand concept is trying to explain it to other people, this is why "3Blue1Brown" came into being.

My understanding on linear algebra boosted after watching 3Blue1Blown", and at the same time, the knowledge was explained in English--without subtitle. So at the same time, I can practice my English listening while learning math.

This experience inspire me that we should study actively and search for studying resource wherever we can. You can't just sit there and wait for knowledge.
