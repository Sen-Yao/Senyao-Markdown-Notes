## Weakly reflections

This week, we watched a video called "Hello world, this is China".In order to let the world understand China more deeply, This video use unique editing skills to show China's superiority of economics, technology, culture and people's livelihood. As a Chinese, proud welled up inside her when I watched this video. 

As we all know, China has a modern history of humiliation, many revolutionary predecessors sacrificed their personal interests to contribute a brighter future of China.

Today, as all the achievements China has made flashed on the screen, tears of proud came into my eyes. Although the material conditions in China has been improved a lot, we should never stop our steps to develop the future of China.
