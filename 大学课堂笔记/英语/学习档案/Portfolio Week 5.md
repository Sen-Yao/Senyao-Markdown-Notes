# Portfolio Week 5

---

I have been focused on preparing my presentation for weeks. And I've Encountered a few problems while preparing.

First of all is that I find it hard to decorate my Powerpoint file. I spent a lot of time searching on the Internet to download images and videos. That takes up so much time that I can't spare enough time to prepare my calculus exam!

And unavoidable new words also bothered me a lot! Trying to give a perfect presentation and be stuck by a certain new word every time!, You can't imagine how frustrated I was!

But with determination, I finally made it! Now I'm fully prepared, and can't wait to give my polished presentation to all of my classmate!
