## Weakly reflections

There's tons of misconstrue around us. As for me, I discover that Fujian is misconstrued in some way by many people in HUST.

### Provincial capital

It's strange that many people consider Xiamen as the provincial capital of Fujian. In fact, it is Fuzhou instead. 

To be honest, Xiamen is much famous to people from other provinces than Fuzhou, for its fascinating landscape and interesting modern history. As one of most popular tourist destinations in China, Xiamen enjoys much greater popularity than Fuzhou that many people mistakenly think Xiamen is the provincial capital of Fujian.

### Mandarin

There's rumour that people in Fujian that can't speak Mandarin correctly. 

Well, as far as I know, this situation does exist in Fujian, especially elders in remote areas, they even can not speak Mandarin at all!

But as the economy of Fujian grows, student can get better education in school. 

So for most of young people in Fujian, they can speak Mandarin as fluently as people from other provinces!
