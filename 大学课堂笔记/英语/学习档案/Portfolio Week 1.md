## Self introduction

My name is 林子垚.

In my childhood, a teacher I really admired used to call me "Oliver", so you can also call me "Oliver.Lin"

I come from Xiamen, which is a island that people can live leisurely and carefree. Grown up by the sea, I really like swimming in the sea and enjoy sunshine on the beach.

I'm not the kind of people that can always get on well with other as soon as they meet strangers, but I always like to develop truehearted friendship with others.

My English vocabulary is larger than many peers, so I can always read English article more easily. However, I seldom speak English, which means that I may feel a little bit nervous when I'm speaking English toward people.

## New term resolution

According to my English proficiency, the first resolution I'd like to make is strengthen my spoken English. In order to get more confidence when speaking, I have to practice English pronunciation by watching video on Youtube and read out loudly.

## Weakly reflections

I was isolated for more than two weeks because of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Fujian. So I miss a few English class at the beginning of this academic year. When I back to English class after the isolation is done, I sadly found it hard to pace up with my teacher Mrs.Yao.

Fortunately, my roommates always got my back and help me adapt to brand new school life in HUST. With their selfless help, I began to love the live there!
