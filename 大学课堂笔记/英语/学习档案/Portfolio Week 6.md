# Portfolio Week 6

---

What impressed me the most is how classmate reacted when i finished my well prepared presentation. At that moment, i feel all the hard work had paid off!

To be honest, I'm not a very profession presenter, and I always consider my spoken English as "Not good enough".But this week, I present my well prepared PowerPoint, which is about game designing, and it gain popular between classmate and applause from Mrs.Yao!

Being encouraged by this successful presentation, I'm full of confident to improve my English presenting to a higher level.
