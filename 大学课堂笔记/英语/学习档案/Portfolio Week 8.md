# Portfolio Week 8

I found myself fell in love with "FPV-drone" this year. 

FPV, or "First person view", is a very interesting way to control drone. Just like its name, the pilot wears a special goggle, which has a mini-screen in it. At the same time, a tiny camera will be set on the drone. Ones the drone is powered, the camera will start working, and the video transmitter will transmit video signal to pilot' goggle continuously. So for pilot, he can get the first-person-view by goggle, just like he is on the drone!

I took up this hobby in July and have been paying much effort practice my FPV skill. Last week, a competition named "Aviation Cup" held by School of aerospace engineering in HUST. In this competition, I gain the first award!
