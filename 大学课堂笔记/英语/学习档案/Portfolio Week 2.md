## Weakly reflections

As Mrs.Yao introduced the concept of EQ in class, I can't help but want to know more abut EQ.

EQ, or the abbreviation for 'emotional quotient', is a very important quality of people. High EQ people aware both themselves and other people around them. They grasp the way to manage their relationship excellently.

In my opinion, these qualities are really important in these time. Only the person who can keeps IQ and EQ balanced will perform better in both work and life.

Then, we watched a serious of video about how people control their emotion. The words impressed me the most is from a optimistic girl."We should focus on what we can do instead of what we could have done."
